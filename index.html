      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm David, a student at Patrick Henry High School. Technology and photography are my passions, and I love diving into them. Since I was young, I've been fascinated by how things like computers and phones function. Coding is like solving a puzzle, and I enjoy creating my own software and websites.</p>
      <p>Photography also grabbed my attention early on. I discovered its power to capture moments, emotions, and stories. Photography lets me express myself in a visual way, connecting with others on a deeper level.</p> 
      <p>I'm eager to keep learning and growing in both technology and photography. I'm always up for workshops, hackathons, and collaborations to expand my skills. My goal is to bring together technology and art, using coding and photography to make a positive impact in the world.</p
